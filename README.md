## About

Hexagn is designed to be a simple language that is compiled to [URCL](#urcl)

The syntax of Hexagn is designed to be simple so anyone could learn and understand the syntax easily without any troubles.
It is a statically typed language.

The URCL code that Hexagn files are compiled to use stack-based allocations for return values and arguments, which means
that the user can access function arguments using the stack pointer, and set/get return values using push and pop respectively.
